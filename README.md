## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### 1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/venkatthirupathi/Murf_ai.git
cd Murf_ai
```

### 2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. **Set environment variables**
Create a file called `.env` in the project root and add:

```bash
MURF_API_KEY=your-murf-api-key
ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY=your-assemblyai-api-key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
```

> **Note:** All 3 keys are required for full functionality. Get them from the respective providers.

### 4. **Create fallback audio**
Create a `static/fallback.mp3` file with a simple message like "I'm having trouble connecting right now"

### 5. **Run the server**

**Option A: Using the startup script (recommended)**
```bash
python run.py
```

**Option B: Using uvicorn directly**
```bash
python -m uvicorn app:app --reload
```

Then open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

3. **Click again or press spacebar** to stop recording
4. **Watch AI respond in real-time** - responses stream word-by-word
5. **Audio plays automatically** when the response is complete
6. **Recording automatically resumes** after the AI finishes speaking

### **Streaming Features**
- **Real-time responses** appear as AI thinks
- **WebSocket connection** for instant communication

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- **Microphone not working**: Check browser permissions and refresh the page
- **API errors**: Verify all API keys are set correctly in your `.env` file
- **Audio not playing**: Check browser console for errors, ensure fallback.mp3 exists
- **Streaming not working**: Check WebSocket connection status, verify Gemini API supports streaming
- **Connection issues**: Ensure all services are accessible from your network
